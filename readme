Hi! Welcome to this terrible library:

Currently it is nonfunctional. Rephrased, the neurons, layers, and forward prop all work. Back prop is nonexistant. 

An example code of utilization is given in temp.cpp

List = all layers, all neurons. Entire framework

Layer = individual layer. Includes vector of neurons, each with a row and col id.

Neuron = includes id of row and col.
